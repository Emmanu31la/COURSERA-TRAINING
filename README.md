# 🌸 Cute Pink Clock (v1.2.2)

A stylish, responsive digital clock web application featuring multiple themes, ticking sound, and persistent user settings.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time Clock**: Highly accurate time tracking with 12-hour and 24-hour toggle modes.
- **Theming Engine**: Choose between **Pink Dream**, **Baby Blue**, **Jet Black**, **Fiery Red**, and **Purple Plum**.
- **Memory (Persistence)**: Uses `localStorage` to remember your chosen theme even after you refresh the page.
- **Audio Feedback**: A realistic "ticking" sound that can be muted/unmuted.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Custom-tailored layouts for Desktop and Mobile (tested on Samsung S20 Ultra and Itel P55).

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox layout, and Media Queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, Event Listeners, and the Web Storage API.

## 📱 Mobile Optimization
This project uses **Fluid Typography** via the `clamp()` function and specific breakpoints to ensure the clock fits perfectly on all screen sizes, preventing text overflow and layout breaking.
